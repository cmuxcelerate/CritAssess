	<h1>Scenario 3 of 7</h1>
	<p>
		Your company is building a learning management system that’s specially tailored to <app-glossary term="K12" definition="kindergarten through 12th grade"></app-glossary> project-based learning. 
	</p>
	<p>
		After extensive <app-glossary term="user research" definition="implementing tools such as interviews and surveys to better understand the intended audience"></app-glossary>, your <app-glossary term="UX" definition="user experience"></app-glossary> department provides you with a list of features that teachers and students want to include in the product.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Upload Project Proposal</li>
		<li>Define Learning Goals</li>
		<li>Set Weekly Goals</li>
		<li>Upload Daily Progress</li>
		<li>Add Collaborators</li>
		<li>Make Audio Comments</li>
		<li>View Achievement Visualization</li>
		<li>Upload Self-reflection</li>
		<li>Receive a Detailed Achievement Report</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Here are some quotes from students and teachers about what they expect to have in the product that your UX team reported to you:	
	</p>

	<p>
		Quote 1 (Student): “I think the adding weekly goals is a really useful function as it helps me know what I am supposed to achieve by the end of the week.”
	</p>

	<p>
		Quote 2 (Teacher): “I think the adding weekly goals is pretty important because it would allow you to easily check students’ progress. Making audio comments might be a great feature as well, because it could save me time in grading student work.”
	</p>

	<p>
		Quote 3 (e-learning director): "Our research team has found that if students upload self-reflection online, it helps improve their performance.” 
	</p>

	<p>
		There are already some equivalent products on the market, and your marketing department has provided you with a competitive matrix which displays the features of each product. Currently, your company wants to build a <app-glossary term="MVP" definition="Minimum Viable Product: the lowest-quality version of the product that can be released"></app-glossary> that covers basic features but could also differentiate itself in this niche market.
