	<h1>Scenario 7 of 7</h1>

	<p>
		You work as a product manager in an insurance company that sells life insurance. Your business model is to have sales representatives help customers to understand the value of life insurance using financial planning software. This involves collaboration from 3 teams: finance, technical and sales.
	</p>

	<p>
		The finance team serves as domain experts who inform the design of the financial planning software.They argue that in order to create the most accurate and useful financial plans, the software should be robust and versatile, taking into account inflation rates, base income, fluctuations, ect.
	</p>

	<p>
		The technical team builds the algorithm to make predictions and generate interpretable results that are provided to the sales team to make the best sales call.
	</p>

	<p>
		The sales team is the end touch-point with your customers. They make use of the results generated by the algorithm to convince customers that purchasing life insurance is to their benefit.
	</p>

	<p>
		Recently, your finance team and technical team worked together to update the algorithm. The new algorithm would take into account various additional inputs like changing inflation rates to produce more accurate estimates. However, it would require significantly more input from potential customers, costing them more time and thus it would complicate the sales process. Your sales team and technical team are at odds with each other regarding whether or not to implement this new algorithm.
