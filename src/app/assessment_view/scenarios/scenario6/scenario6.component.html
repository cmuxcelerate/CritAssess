	<h1>Scenario 6 of 7</h1>

	<p>
		You are in charge of building a demo that is supposed to be shown to your client next week. Although this original schedule gave you one week, your manager suddenly sends you an email saying that she needs to show the demo to a customer in two days. Your original schedule was to let the alerting system generate rules automatically based on dynamic data, which would need a week to be complete.
