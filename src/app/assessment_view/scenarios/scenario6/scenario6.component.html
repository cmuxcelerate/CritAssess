	<h1>Scenario 6 of 7</h1>

	<p>
		You are in charge of building a demo that is supposed to be shown to your client next week. Although the original schedule was one week, your manager suddenly sent you an email said that he needs to show a demo to a customer two days later. Your original schedule is to let the alerting system generate rules automatically based on dynamic data which would need a week to complete.
