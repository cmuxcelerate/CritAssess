			<h2>About our project</h2>
			<p>
				How are non-technical skills currently being assessed in secondary school students? Which non-technical skills are the most important for students who would want to pursue STEM careers in the future? Our methods for unpacking these questions included literature review, expert interviews, stakeholder intervwiews, and competitive analysis, as well as cognitive task analysis with twelfth-graders. This process revealed the multidimensional ways in which critical thinking is used in computer science contexts. Our findings are organized to step through WHY we focused on critical thinking, WHAT critical thinking entails, and HOW critical thinking is used across stakeholder groups.

			<h2>Hunt statement</h2>
			<p>
				We will analyze the alignment of existing nontechnical skills course materials and research on learning science to design robust assessments that empower secondary school students to develop, evaluate, and demonstrate the critical thinking skills required for 21st century careers in data science, AI, CS and cybersecurity.

			<h2>Why Critical Thinking</h2>
			<p>
				Many frameworks describe 21st-century skills, including sources such as Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), Center for Curriculum Redesign (CCR), Assessment and Teaching of 21st Century Skills (ATCS), National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and many more (Refer to Group 1, Literature Review of Soft Skills in the Appendix). Assessments for 21st-century skills are no longer considered in isolation from content knowledge as seen in the Meta Learning map (Fig. 6) Through synthesizing key takeaways from literature review of non-technical skills broadly, critical thinking surfaced as the skill that was both the most sought out in technical jobs and found lacking in secondary school students. A curated selection of our evidence is as follows:
			</p>
			<ol type="1">
				<li>
					According to Cimmati B., (2016), critical thinking and problem solving skills are skills which are both essential as well as hard to hire. Cimmati also lists critical thinking among the top three skills which are essential for technical jobs.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Gallup study (2018) commissioned by NWEA , examined national perceptions of K-12 assessments among a range of stakeholders, namely administrators, teachers and parents. It was found that:

				<!-- Gallup poll sub-points -->
				<ol type="a">
					<li>
						It was important in the opinions of all the stakeholders that critical thinking skills should be well assessed. The other two most important were problem-solving and ability to apply knowledge to real-world situations.
					</li>
					<li>
						42% of the teachers thought that critical thinking was assessed only “somewhat well” in their schools. 
					</li>
				</ol> <!-- End Gallup poll sub-points -->
				<li>
					The Hanover research (2014) examines some of the best practices in assessing soft skills also discusses a 2006 study conducted by the Conference Board in collaboration with the Partnership for 21st Century Schools (P21) that found a 70% of employers rated that critical thinking skills were deficient in high school graduates.

				</li>
				<li>
					Center for Curriculum Redesign report on workforce assessments for the 21st Century (2016), talks about critical thinking among the top three requested skills by major employer surveys. This report also talks about the very little assessment of critical thinking in the US, mainly due to the fact that there is a large difference in scoring among the major and minor (ethnic) groups.

			<h2>About the Gap Model</h2>
			<p>
				The gap model is the highest-level synthesis of our research. It draws on findings from all of our stakeholder interviews, as well as our literature review to contrast the use of critical thinking skills in workplace and secondary school contexts. Through it, we highligh the gaps between academic practice and the demands of 21st century computer science careers. During affinity diagramming, we grouped and categorized examples of non-technical skills being put into practice in both computer science careers and secondary school coursework. Comparing the two contexts revealed clear overlaps, near overlaps, and, of most interestmost interestingly, gaps.

			<h2>Insights</h2>
			<!-- Insight 1 -->
			<strong>Insight 1: Critical thinking is vital to employment in computer science careers</strong>
			<p>
				For current computer science jobs, employers explicitly expressed that they are looking for critical thinking skills during interviews. Some employers treat critical thinking skills as a differentiator between candidates who have similar technically proficiency, while others view critical thinking as a prerequisite that helps filter candidates at the earliest stages. Yet, all were unanimous in agreeing that critical thinking skills are vital to daily work and long-term professional growth for employees in computer science fields.

			<!-- Insight 2 -->
			<strong>Insight 2: Students don’t receive explicit instruction defining critical thinking skills and consequently don’t know what critical thinking means</strong>
			<p>
				Currently, secondary school students get most of their critical thinking practice during project work, often in pairs or teams. Critical thinking skills are rarely taught explicitly, but rather, are subtly integrated into coursework. As a result, secondary school students generally have, at best, a vague understanding of what critical thinking skills are and how they are valued by employers.
			</p>
			<div class="imgWrap">
				<img src="./assets/insight2.png">
			</div>

			<!-- Insight 3 -->
			<strong>Insight 3: Secondary school students are impulsive and have difficulty generating and evaluating ideas with an open mind</strong>
			<p>
				Secondary school students tend to emotionally commit to their first idea, often without generating alternatives, let alone evaluating them objectively or seeking critique. Often when secondary school students reason about their ideas, they are rationalizing to produce a justification of an idea they are already committed to rather than evaluating advantages and disadvantages with an open mind. This results in lower-quality ideation and is a part of why employers have difficulty finding entry level applicants who excel at rational and/or collaborative decision making.
			</p>
			<div class="imgWrap">

			</div>

			<!-- Insight 4 -->
			<strong>Insight 4: Secondary school students rarely use reflection to iterate their work or their process</strong>
			<p>
				One of the key gaps in the use of critical thinking skills in work vs academic contexts is how reflection is incorporated into project work. Reflection appears often in daily computer science related work, both to improve one’s work and one’s self. While reflection is integrated iteratively into the problem solving process in workplace contexts, in school, reflection is largely relegated to discrete exercises at the end of a project. The results of these reflections are not used to drive improvements because they represent the end of a project rather than a part of the process.

		<h2>Summer development</h2>
		<p>
			We drew on our research insights to generate and consolidate four potential solutions which could help secondary school students discover, learn, and demonstrate the critical thinking skills most essential to 21st century computer science careers. During our Spring Meeting, we workshopped our four ideas with our client in a co-design session to set our direction for the summer. During the summer semester, we engaged in prototyping, analysis, and user-testing to produce prototypes with increasing fidelity and iteratively test them with users to improve the design. The final product serves as a high fidelity working prototype.
